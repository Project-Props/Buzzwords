Buzzwords from chapter 2
========================

## Actor
Any external entity that interacts with the system, could be a user, another system,
the systems environment etc.

## Use case
Focuses on the behavior of the system from an external point of view.
Describes something that yields a visible result for an actor.
Focuses on completely and describing all possible cases.

## Scenario
A narrative description of what people do and experience as they try to make use of a computer systme and applications.
A concrete, focused, informal, description of a single feature of the system from the viewport of a single actor.

## Abstraction
To ignore unessential details for focus on whats really important
Can be both a process or an entity

## Use case diagrams
Use case diagrams represent the functionality of the system" from userâ€™s point of view.
A clear end.
Clear what the actors are.
Clear which actions triggers what.

## Class diagrams
Represent the structure of the system
Multiplicity is the amount of something that something has.
Like a watch has 2 buttons and a button has 1 watch. So buttons have multiplicity 2 and watch have multiplicity 1.
Might also contain things like methods and instance variables.

## Sequence diagrams
Sequence diagrams represent the behaviour of a system as messages ("interactions") between different objects
It could describe how a user instance interacts with an actual watch instance.

## Statechart diagrams
Represent behavior of a single object with interesting dynamic behavior

## Other OO words
Other words from OO would probably be good to know. These are things like inhertiance, composition, instance, class, superclass, etc...
