Buzzwords from chapter 1
========================

# Modeling
To build a model representing a complex system in order to easier understand it.
We are able to ignore irrelevant details.

# OO software development
Typically includes the following activities:

- Requirements elicitation
- Analysis
- System design
- OO design
- Implementation
- Testing

# Knowledge acquisition
Learning stuff about something (non linear)

# Risk based development
???. Seen on page 7.

# Issue-base development
???. Seen on page 7.

# Rationale
Understand the context in which design decisions were made. This will make it easier to change the system later on. Simply understanding how the system works is not enough.

# Participants
All the people involved in the project.

# System
A collection of interconnected parts

# Role
A set of responsibilities in the project or the system.

# Activity (aka phases)
A set of tasks that is performed toward a specific purpose.

# Requirements elicitation
An activity whose purpose is to define with the client what the system will do.
Define the purpose of the system.
The result of this is a description of the system in term of actors and use cases.

# Analysis
Produce a model of that system that is correct, complete, consistent, and unambiguous.
The result is a system model annotated with attributes, operations, and associations.

# System design
Defining the goals of the project and decompose the system into smaller subsystems that can be realized by individual teams.
Technology decisions are also made, such as what hardware, language and so on.

# Object design
Developers define the solution domain objects to bridge the gap between the Analysis model and the hardware platform defined earlier.

# Implementation
Translate the solution domain into actual source code.

# Testing
...

# Task
An atomic unit of work that can be managed.

# Resources
The assets that are used to accomplish work. Can include time, equipment, labor etc...

# Functional requirements
A specification of a function that the system must support.
"The user must be able to purchase tickets"
"The user must be able to access tariff information"

# Non-functional requirements
A constraint on the operation of the system that is not related directly to a function of the system.
"The user must be provided feedback in less than one second"
"The colors used in the interface should be consistent with the company colors"

# Notation
Graphical or textual set of rules for representing a model.
For example the alphabet is a notation for representing words.

# Method
Repeatable technique that specifies the steps involved in solving a specific problem.

# Methodology
A collection of methods for solving a class of problems and specifies how and when each method should be used.
